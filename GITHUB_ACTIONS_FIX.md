# GitHub Actions - Build Fixed! âœ…

## The Problem
GitHub deprecated v3 of upload-artifact. I've updated everything to v4.

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Use the Updated Workflow (Already Done!)

1. **Commit and push the updated workflow:**
```bash
git add .github/workflows/build-windows.yml
git commit -m "Fix: Update GitHub Actions to v4"
git push
```

2. **Go to GitHub â†’ Actions tab**

3. **Run the workflow manually:**
   - Click "Build Windows Executable"
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Click green "Run workflow" button

4. **Download your .exe:**
   - Wait for build to complete (2-3 minutes)
   - Click on the workflow run
   - Scroll down to "Artifacts"
   - Download "PLC-Toolkit-Windows-Build-XX.zip"

### Option 2: Use Simple Manual Workflow

I've also created a simpler workflow: `.github/workflows/build-simple.yml`

This one:
- Only runs manually (not on every push)
- Uses Windows Server 2022 specifically
- Has version numbering

To use it:
1. Push to GitHub
2. Go to Actions â†’ "Build Windows EXE (Simple)"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter version number (optional)
5. Download artifact

## What Changed?

### Old (broken):
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v3        # Outdated
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3  # DEPRECATED
```

### New (working):
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4        # Latest
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4  # Current version
- uses: actions/setup-python@v5     # Updated
- uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2  # Updated
```

## Quick Commands

### Push everything and trigger build:
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Update PLC Toolkit and fix GitHub Actions"

# Push to GitHub
git push

# Then go to GitHub.com â†’ Your Repo â†’ Actions â†’ Run workflow
```

### Check workflow syntax (optional):
```bash
# Install act (GitHub Actions locally)
brew install act

# Test workflow
act -n  # Dry run
```

## Troubleshooting

**Still getting errors?**

1. **Check branch name:**
   - Workflow triggers on `main` or `master`
   - Check your default branch: `git branch`

2. **Permissions issue?**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General
   - Set "Workflow permissions" to "Read and write"

3. **Try the simple workflow instead:**
   - Use `build-simple.yml` - it's more basic

4. **Last resort - Direct Windows build:**
   - Send `BUILD_FOR_WINDOWS.bat` to a Windows user
   - They run it and send back the .exe
